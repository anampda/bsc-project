## Optical sensor for monitoring the evaporation of ternary mixtures

The main objective of this work was the monitoring of evaporation of ternary mixtures by means of an optical sensor. Several sensing heads were produced, by fusion splicing a section of hollow square core fiber between two single mode fibers. The spectral characterization of each sensor was carried out, in a transmission scheme, and two interferometers were observed: a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) and a cladding modal interferometer (CMI). A sensor was characterized towards refractive index variations, where the CMI was the only component sensitive to this measurand. A maximum sensitivity of (423 Â± 50) nm/RIU was attained for the ternary mixture. The evaporation profile of the ternary mixtures was attained with success.
